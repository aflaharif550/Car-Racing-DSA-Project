PROJECT DESCRIPTION
	GAME OVERVIEW AND FEATURES:-
The Car Racing Game is a sophisticated console-based C++ application that masterfully blends entertainment with computer science education through its dual-mode gameplay system. The project features Manual Mode for interactive player control and Automated Mode that demonstrates Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm within a dynamically generated 20x15 maze environment. Players navigate through complex pathways while collecting power-ups for enhanced scoring, avoiding health-depleting obstacles, gathering coins for additional points, and utilizing health packs for recovery, all governed by a multifaceted scoring system that evaluates performance based on completion time, distance traveled, item collection efficiency, and hazard avoidance. The game's visual appeal is significantly enhanced through ANSI escape codes providing vibrant colors, while persistent data storage maintains leaderboard information and player achievements. Additional features include customizable visual elements, comprehensive pause functionality, and robust health management with multiple retry opportunities, all implemented through professional software development practices including modular architecture, systematic error handling, efficient memory management, and user-centric interface design that together create both an engaging gaming experience and a valuable educational demonstration of programming principles.

	ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN:-
The Car Racing Game's technical foundation employs a carefully engineered architecture emphasizing modularity, efficiency, and scalability through object-oriented programming principles with well-defined class structures including Graph for game world management, AVLTree for leaderboard operations, LinkedListForCoins for dynamic item tracking, and SimpleQueueForObstacles for systematic obstacle processing. The game loop ensures smooth real-time interaction in Manual Mode by processing inputs, updating states, rendering displays, and managing collisions, while Automated Mode leverages sophisticated graph algorithms to compute optimal paths using Dijkstra's algorithm. The system utilizes C++ chrono library for precise time tracking, random number generation for varied maze configurations, and robust file I/O operations for persistent leaderboard data with error-resistant parsing. Memory management incorporates proper allocation and deallocation practices in linked list and tree implementations, and keyboard input processing provides responsive controls without enter key requirements, collectively delivering a feature-rich gaming experience that balances computational efficiency with functional requirements while demonstrating practical data structure applications.

DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION
	GRAPH STRUCTURE FOR MAZE NAVIGATION SYSTEM:-
The game world utilizes a graph data structure through a 20x15 grid where each cell functions as a node containing type classification, value, and visitation status, with edge definitions creating movement pathways between adjacent nodes. This implementation enables sophisticated pathfinding algorithms and spatial relationship representation, making it ideal for the maze environment where certain paths remain accessible while others are blocked.

	AVL TREE FOR EFFICIENT LEADERBOARD ORGANIZATION:-
The project employs a self-balancing AVL binary search tree for leaderboard management, where each node stores player names and scores while maintaining height information. The tree automatically performs rotations to ensure O(log n) time complexity for all operations, providing efficient score sorting in descending order and rapid search capabilities while handling imbalance scenarios during data insertion.


	LINKED LIST FOR DYNAMIC COIN COLLECTION:-
A singly linked list manages coin collection throughout gameplay, with each node representing individual coins containing value, coordinates, and pointer to the next coin. This structure allows efficient addition and removal of coins through dynamic memory allocation, accommodating variable coin quantities while providing traversal mechanisms for collision detection between the player's car and collectible coin
	QUEUE STRUCTURE FOR SYSTEMATIC OBSTACLE MANAGEMENT:-
The game implements a queue data structure using a linked list approach to process obstacles in first-in-first-out order during maze generation. Each queue node stores obstacle coordinates, with front and rear references enabling efficient enqueue and dequeue operations that ensure systematic processing in creation sequence, contributing to consistent maze generation patterns while demonstrating practical application of abstract data types.
	STACK MECHANISM FOR IMPLICIT FUNCTION CALL:-
The project conceptually utilizes stack structures through the program's call stack and recursion-based algorithms, where depth-first search in tree traversals and path reconstruction in Dijkstra's algorithm rely on implicit stack operations. This recursive approach enables efficient processing of tree nodes in sorted order and path reversal, demonstrating how fundamental stack concepts permeate algorithm implementation without explicit instantiation.
	DIJKSTRA’S ALGORITHM(FOR SHORTEST PATH):-
The project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for computing optimal paths between user-specified positions by initializing nodes with infinite distances except the start point, then systematically exploring neighbors while maintaining shortest paths through distance matrices and parent tracking. Each iteration selects the minimum-distance unvisited node, updates neighbor distances when shorter paths are found, and marks nodes as visited while incorporating obstacle avoidance by excluding barrier nodes. Following computation, the algorithm reconstructs the optimal path by backtracking from destination to source using parent pointers, then reverses the sequence for start-to-end presentation. The visualization system animates car movement along the computed path with controlled delays, demonstrating algorithmic progression while serving both practical navigation and educational purposes by showcasing graph theory applications in gaming environments
	SUMMARY:-
The Car Racing Game project successfully demonstrates the practical integration of data structures and algorithms in software development, creating an engaging educational gaming experience. By implementing graphs for maze navigation, AVL trees for leaderboard management, linked lists for coin collection, and queues for obstacle processing, the project showcases comprehensive understanding of computer science fundamentals. The dual-mode gameplay effectively balances entertainment and education, with manual mode providing interactive racing and automated mode visualizing Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. Through professional coding practices, efficient memory management, and robust error handling, the project bridges theoretical concepts with real-world application, delivering both an entertaining game and a valuable demonstration of data structure implementation in C++ programming. The project's modular architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, while the implementation of balanced trees and efficient pathfinding algorithms highlights strong analytical and problem-solving skills. This comprehensive approach not only delivers a fully functional gaming application but also serves as an exemplary model of how theoretical computer science concepts can be effectively applied in practical software development scenarios.
